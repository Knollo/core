Upgrading from Core 1.3 to 1.4
==============================

Legacy Layers
-------------

All legacy APIs from the Zikula Core 1.2.x series that were supported in 
Zikula Core 1.3 have been completely removed. This means only 
fully Zikula Core 1.3.x complaint modules will work, and preferably 
they should be compliant to Zikula Core 1.3.6+ standards.
